# User Journey
A user wants to find a science fiction book set in space. They sign into their Skrib account and check their posts for comments. Having found one with a book, they look up the book and add it to their want to read shelf. They then go to the search page and search with the books tag "science-fiction" and the tag "space", where they find another book they add to their want to read shelf. Now that they've found new books to read, they log out and go to the bookstore.
