# User Journey
A user wants to find a classic dystopia novel to read, so they make and account on skrib. They first look to the forum page, where users can ask and look for recommendations, to see if someone else has gotten dystopia recommendations. No one has, but someone was looking for mystery novel recommendations, which the user does have. They comment on the post with the book title, then go to the search page. They add the dystopia and classics tags to their search queries and get two results. They tag the book they want with "want-to-read" to keep track for next time, then log out.
